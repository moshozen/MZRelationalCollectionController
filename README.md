# MZRelationalCollectionController

MZRelationalCollectionController manages KVO on a named relation of an object,
providing delegate notification on various changes to the content of the
relation, as well as on changes to specified attributes of the objects in the
relation collection. Very loosely inspired by NSArrayController and
NSFetchedResultsController

## Usage

Usage is straightforward; see the header files for method details.

## Requirements

MZRelationalCollectionController requires ARC (this is not a strict requirement.
If you need non-ARC compatibility, please open an issue).
